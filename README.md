# ts-linqlite
A lightweight Typescript Linq library
This library uses a light wrapper layer to implement C# Linq-like query methods.

As this project is still in its early stage, it's consisted of one single file and can be dropped into your project to use directly. Later I will consider to make a npm package for it.
